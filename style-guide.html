                I have chosen to use the following fonts for my site:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Roboto+Mono: Used for headlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    DotGothic16: Used for the primary font.
                </li>

            <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, there! My name is Ryan Funk, and I work for Allen Ship Center which helps store and deliver shipments. Have you been to a ship center when delivering a 
                package, and if so, was the process complicated and confusing? At Allen Ship Center, we put a heavy focus on making our customer’s experience at our 
                locations simple and easy. We want to make sure that creating a shipment is straightforward and clear to new customers to provide a swift and satisfactory 
                service. Are you interested in connecting with the company to learn more about their business?
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The website for Allen Ship Center could fulfill more than more purpose. It may provide a descriptive resource for relevant information. This can include 
                details regarding the company, its staff, history, policies, tools used in the workplace, and answers to general inquiries from customers. Ultimately, 
                because Allen Ship Center is a business, the website needs to function to help the company earn an income. This includes providing their locations, 
                offers and prices, reviews, and general details to entice potential customers to use their service and revisit it. The site needs to be concise and 
                easy to navigate to leave an admirable impression.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Audience Statement</h2>
            <p>
                One demographic that Allen Ship Center appeals to are individuals who have connections over long distance. These people desire to connect beyond virtual 
                communication. They may want to exchange goods but have trouble because of travel (this can also apply to shorter distances during COVID-19 when social 
                interaction is more difficult). Allen Ship’s service makes it so that people can deliver these shipments. Because the company wants to reach out to as 
                many people as possible, the website will be compatible with all common devices. Customers will have access to the services offered on the site at any 
                place and any time.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Misson Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of Allen Ship Center is to provide an approachable shipping service for the general market. The company will be primarily based in the United States, 
                at least until it’s succeeded well enough to expand further international. Allen Ship recognizes the complications and confusion that can arise during shipment. 
                Thus, it will intend to stand out in the competitive shipping market by making the shipment creation process on location straightforward and simple. The business 
                wants a future where people can connect with distanced friends, family, and professional contacts beyond virtual communication through physical exchange. 
            </p>

                Jerry is the man behind Allen Ship Center's mission to serve as the most accesible, cooperative, and helpful shipping center in the market. Growing up, Jerry 
                would send letters and gifts to his extended family members, and he felt frustrated by how difficult shipment companies made it out to be. Now as a founder of one, 
                he is determined to change that trend. Even after the company's establishment over ten years ago, Jerry is still heavily involved with the staff on location and is an essential 
                leader over the team.

                Hollie has served as manager over Allen Ship Center's chain for well over four years which is longer than any other manager. She is essential in keeping staff 
                motivated, welcomed, and focused; maintaining the location, and making important decisions that have brought Allen Ship Center further success.

            <p class="col-2">
                Tamara currently works as Customer Support. She was particularly placed there for her stellar ability to resolve customer concerns and answer questions through 
                her attentive listening and effective problem solving. It's this skillset that has landed her on Employee of the Month longer than any other employee. She is a 
                prime example for Allen Ship Center's image and is the reason for our high customer satisfaction.
